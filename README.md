### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm a Senior Software Engineer with a huge passion for developing cloud native solutions in AWS.

âš¡ Fun fact: I use two sets of keyboard/mouse per day.

During :sun_with_face: hours
- ErgoDox EZ (keyboard) and Logitech MX ERGO (mouse)

During :last_quarter_moon_with_face: hours
- Razer BlackWidow Tournament Edition Chroma (keyboard) and Razer DeathAdder Chroma (mouse)
